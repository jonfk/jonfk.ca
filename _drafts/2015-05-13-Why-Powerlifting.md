I haven't been powerlifting for long enough to claim to have gained any
sort of wisdom or deep insight into powerlifting but one thing I seemed to
notice recently is the increasing popularity of powerlifting. There are more
and more popular powerlifting fitness channels on youtube, instagram is brimming
with powerlifting training videos and even on my local level, there are more
competitors in meets year over year. Why is that?

Geared powerlifting, where the competitors can wear squat suits, bench shirts and deadlift suits
to improve their lifts, has been underground and popular in some form with a specific crowd of people
for years, but in the last few years, raw powerlifting has taken over in popularity and surpassed
geared powerlifting. The reason is simple, geared powerlifting costs much more investment for the
equipment and is very hard on the body. Raw powerlifting is also simpler and more easily understandable.
But why the recent uptake of popularity of raw powerlifting?
